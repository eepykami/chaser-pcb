# chaser-pcb
Little pin-sized, battery-powered PCB to make a few LEDs go blinky. Using an ATTINY microcontroller (exact model to be determined), and a CR2032 coin cell.

This project is what I originally intended [queer-little-pin](https://github.com/eepykami/queer-lil-pin) was meant to be, before feature creep set in and I ended up having an STM32, Li-ion charging circuitry, and a string of Neopixels on it :)
